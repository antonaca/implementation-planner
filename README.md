# Implementation Planner

This is a practical tool designed for implementation researchers and practitioners who need to systematically plan, adapt, document, and manage complex implementation projects. The tool provides a structured, repeatable framework that makes it easy to adapt for different use cases like the [HIV PrEP Protocol Roll-Out](https://github.com/antonaca/hivprep-plan) example.

## Who is this for?

This tool is designed for:
- Implementation practitioners
- Project managers in health, education, or social sectors
- Teams seeking to improve the fidelity and documentation of their implementation processes

## What does it do?

Implementation Planner helps you:
- Break down your implementation project into actionable steps
- Document each phase of your project, including goals, tasks, responsible parties, and timelines
- Track progress and update plans as your project evolves
- Reuse templates for new projects or adapt from existing plans (e.g., see the [hivprep-plan](https://github.com/antonaca/hivprep-plan) repository for an applied example)

## How to Use the Implementation Planner

### 1. Clone or Fork this Repository

Start by cloning or forking the `implementation-planner` repository to your own GitHub account or organization:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonaca/implementation-planner.git
```

### 2. Understand the Structure

- The planner is organized using HTML files and folders representing different sections or phases of implementation.
- Typical sections might include: _Exploration_, _Preparation_, _Implementation_, _Sustainment_.
- Each phase contains templates for tasks, responsible parties, timelines, and documentation.

### 3. Create a New Implementation Plan

**Option A:**  
_Use This Template_ (recommended for new projects)

1. Copy the structure of this repository into a new repo for your project (e.g., `myproject-implementation-plan`).
2. Rename folders and files as appropriate for your context.
3. Edit the HTML files in each section, filling in the details for your specific implementation case.

**Option B:**  
_Refer to an Example_

- Explore [HIV PrEP Protocol Roll-Out](https://github.com/antonaca/hivprep-plan) to see how the planner has been customized and completed for a real-world project.
- Use it as a guide or starting point.

### 4. Populate Your Plan

For each section of the implementation:

- Define objectives, tasks, and deliverables
- Assign responsible team members
- Specify timelines and milestones
- Use the provided HTML templates for consistency

### 5. Document and Track Progress

- Keep your plan updated as implementation progresses.
- Use GitHubâ€™s version control and collaboration features to track changes, discuss updates, and record decisions.

### 6. Share and Collaborate

- Invite team members as collaborators in your repository.
- Use GitHub Issues or Discussions to manage questions, changes, and feedback.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency:** Use the same structure for all projects to enable comparison and reuse.
- **Transparency:** Document decisions and changes directly within the plan.
- **Adaptation:** Regularly review and update the plan as implementation progresses.

## Example: HIV PrEP Implementation Plan

The [hivprep-plan](https://github.com/antonaca/hivprep-plan) repository demonstrates how to use Implementation Planner for a health project. Review it for inspiration on customizing the templates for your context.
