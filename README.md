# Implementation Planning Tool
Welcome! This guide is designed to help you use the Implementation Planning & Tracking Tool. This tool will help you design, plan, and monitor your implementation projects from start to finish.
## What is this Tool?
This is a comprehensive, browser-based tool for creating a detailed implementation plan based on established implementation science frameworks. It helps you:
- Structure your thinking using a logic model.
- Select and specify evidence-based implementation strategies.
- Create a detailed protocol with timelines and responsibilities.
- Track progress, risks, and adaptations throughout your project.
- Generate reports to visualize your progress and outcomes.

Important Note on Saving: Your work is saved automatically and stored directly within your web browser. This means your data is private to you and available when you reopen the file on the same computer and in the same browser. However, you will not be able to access this plan on a different computer.

## Navigating the Tool
The main navigation is on the sidebar to the left. Each section represents a key part of your implementation plan.

### 1. Overview
This is the starting point for your project.

Project Title, Goal, and EBP: Define the what and why of your project. Give it a clear name, state its primary goal, and describe the evidence-based practice (EBP) or initiative you are implementing.

Team & Roles: List all the key people involved in the project and their responsibilities. Click the "Add Member" button to add new rows.

### 2. Model
This section helps you build an Implementation Research Logic Model (IRLM). This model is a visual map that connects your strategies to your expected outcomes. The cards on this page flip over to show you a list of items you've entered.
- Determinants: What factors might help or hinder your project? These can be barriers (e.g., "Lack of staff time") or facilitators (e.g., "Strong leadership support").
- Strategies: What specific actions will you take to address your determinants? The tool includes a searchable list of strategies from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) project.
- Mechanisms: How will your strategies work? A mechanism explains the process of change (e.g., a training strategy works by "Increasing staff knowledge and skills").
- Outcomes: What will you measure to see if your project is successful? Outcomes are broken down into three types based on Proctor's Taxonomy...
  - Implementation Outcomes: How well was the implementation process carried out? (e.g., Feasibility, Fidelity, Cost).
  - Service Outcomes: How did the EBP affect service delivery? (e.g., Efficiency, Safety).
  - Client Outcomes: How did the EBP affect the clients or patients? (e.g., Satisfaction, Symptoms).
### 3. Plan
This is where you translate your model into a concrete action plan.
- Protocol: Create a detailed timeline of all activities, tasks, milestones, and events. Assign an owner, set start/end dates, and track the status and progress of each item.
- Fidelity: How will you ensure the EBP is delivered as intended? Identify the "core components" (the essential, non-negotiable parts of your EBP) and plan how you will measure them.
- Instruments: List any surveys, checklists, or other measurement tools you will use to collect data for your outcomes and fidelity measures.
### 4. Log
Implementation is dynamic. This section helps you track changes and new developments as they happen.
- Adaptations: Log any changes or modifications you make to your plan or the EBP itself.
- Risks: Identify potential risks to your project, assess their likelihood and impact, and plan how you will mitigate them.
- Opportunities: Capture unexpected opportunities that arise that could benefit your project.
### 5. Report
This section provides a high-level summary of your entire project.
- Summary & Dashboard: View key performance indicators (KPIs), charts visualizing your progress, and an interactive table of all your protocol activities. This is the perfect place to get a quick overview of project status.
### 6. Glossary
If you encounter any unfamiliar terms (like "determinant" or "fidelity"), the Glossary provides definitions for key concepts used throughout the tool.

## How to Get Started
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see a pre-populated example project to guide you.
2. Start in the "Overview" tab. Change the project title, goal, and team members to match your own project.
3. Navigate to the "Model" tab. Click on the cards to flip them and see the lists of items. Use the "Add..." buttons to start defining your own determinants, strategies, and outcomes.
4. Go to the "Plan" tab. Build out your project timeline in the "Protocol" section.
5. Use the "Log" tab to document adaptations, risks, and opportunities as your project unfolds.
6. Visit the "Report" tab at any time to see a dashboard of your progress.

# üöÄ **Implementation Planner**

This is a practical tool designed for implementation researchers and practitioners who need to systematically plan, adapt, document, and manage complex implementation projects. The tool provides a structured, repeatable framework that makes it easy to adapt for different use cases like the [HIV PrEP Protocol Roll-Out](https://antonaca.github.io/hivprep-plan) example.

## üë∑ **Who is this for?**

This tool is designed for:
- Implementation practitioners
- Researchers and project managers in health, education, or social sectors
- Teams seeking to improve the fidelity and documentation of their implementation processes

## üîß **What does it do?**

This tool applies the Implementation Research Logic Model (IRLM) and Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications to Evidence-based Implementation Strategies (FRAME-IS) to:
- Break down an implementation project into actionable steps
- Identify implementation determinants, select appropriate strategies, specify mechanisms, and document outcomes
- Track progress and adapt plans as a project evolves
- Reuse templates for new projects or adapt from existing plans (e.g., see the [hivprep-plan](https://github.com/antonaca/hivprep-plan) repository for an applied example)

## üèóÔ∏è **How do I use it?**

### 1. Clone or Fork this Repository

Start by cloning or forking the `implementation-planner` repository to your own GitHub account or organization:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonaca/implementation-planner.git
```

### 2. Understand the Structure

- The planner is organized using HTML files and folders representing different sections or phases of implementation.
- Typical sections might include: _Exploration_, _Preparation_, _Implementation_, _Sustainment_.
- Each phase contains templates for tasks, responsible parties, timelines, and documentation.

### 3. Create a New Implementation Plan

**Option A:**  
_Use This Template_ (recommended for new projects)

1. Copy the structure of this repository into a new repo for your project (e.g., `myproject-implementation-plan`).
2. Rename folders and files as appropriate for your context.
3. Edit the HTML files in each section, filling in the details for your specific implementation case.

**Option B:**  
_Refer to an Example_

- Explore [HIV PrEP Protocol Roll-Out](https://antonaca.github.io/hivprep-plan) to see how the planner could be customized and applied in a real-world implementation effort.
- Use it as a guide or starting point.

### 4. Populate the Plan

For each section of the implementation:

- Define objectives, tasks, and deliverables
- Assign responsible team members
- Specify timelines and milestones
- Use the provided HTML templates for consistency

### 5. Document and Track Progress

- Keep your plan updated as implementation progresses.
- Use GitHub‚Äôs version control and collaboration features to track changes, discuss updates, and record decisions.

### 6. Share and Collaborate

- Invite team members as collaborators in your repository.
- Use GitHub Issues or Discussions to manage questions, changes, and feedback.

## üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Best Practices**

- **Consistency:** Use the same structure for all projects to enable comparison and reuse.
- **Transparency:** Document decisions and changes directly within the plan.
- **Adaptation:** Regularly review and update the plan as implementation progresses.

## üëÄ **Example: Community HIV PrEP Protocol Roll-Out Plan**

The [hivprep-plan](https://antonaca.github.io/hivprep-plan) repository demonstrates how to use Implementation Planner for a health project. Review it for inspiration on customizing the templates for your context.
